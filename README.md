# TurtleRace
Result from following Tech With Tim's tutorial for a turtle racing game.

The game was created with python's turtle module. 

It simulates turtle racing using. 
The user can choose to have 2-10 turtles racing. 

In Tim's original game, every turtle had a different color and at the end the winner would be announced in the command line.

In my version of the game, all the turtles are green but have different names and the winner of the race is announced in the window created with the turtle module instead of in the command line.
